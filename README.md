# Safety_and_Attention #
This repo contains the code used to run the simulation and hardware experiments for our 2021 RSS submission:  
*Safe Stochastic Motion Planning Under Constrained Sensing via Duality*

## To run simulation for testing ##
Each command is run in a seperate terminal:  
```roslaunch Safety_and_Attention sim_cam.launch```  
```python commander.py```  
```python robot_control_1.py```  
```python robot_control_2.py```  
```python robot_control_3.py```  
```python unicycle_robot_control_0.py```
